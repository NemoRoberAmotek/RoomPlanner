# Room Planner

## Setup

This project can be launched with or without the [Room Planner REST API](https://github.com/NemoRoberAmotek/RoomPlannerServer).

Rooms will not be saved when the application is not connected to the REST API.

A demo can be found [here](https://roomplanner.onrender.com/).
The demo does not use the REST API, so only Guest mode is available.

### Setting the API URL

Create a `.env` file with the base API url:

`REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://your_api_url`

### Running the project

`npm start`
